Flame Model
***********

The elemental flame model consists of a laminar flame stabilized in a
stagnation flow. The parameters of the stagnation flow may be imposed
explicitly, or provided through coupling with an outer flow within which the
elemental flame is embedded. The kinematics of the coupling between the
elemental flame and the outer flow have been described elsewhere [#Marzouk1999].
Here, the flame is parameterized by the strain rate and position (radius) of
the stagnation point in the non-reacting flow.

The stagnation flow models are described in
:ref:`sec-strained-flame-configurations`. The general 3D conservation equations
for mass, momentum, energy and chemical species are reduced to one dimension by
using a boundary layer approximation across the flame. The derivation of these
governing equations is contained in Section :ref:`sec-governing-equations`.
The boundary conditions for the elemental flame model are discussed in
:ref:`sec-boundary-conditions`.
